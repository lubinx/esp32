                If enabled, chip will try to power down flash as part of esp_light_sleep_start(), which costs
                more time when chip wakes up. Can only be enabled if there is no SPIRAM configured.

                This option will power down flash under a strict but relatively safe condition. Also, it is possible to
                power down flash under a relaxed condition by using esp_sleep_pd_config() to set ESP_PD_DOMAIN_VDDSDIO
                to ESP_PD_OPTION_OFF. It should be noted that there is a risk in powering down flash, you can refer
                `ESP-IDF Programming Guide/API Reference/System API/Sleep Modes/Power-down of Flash` for more details.

                pulse during light sleep, with specific condition

                - GPIO needs to be configured as input-mode only
                - The pin receives a small electrostatic pulse, and reset occurs when the pulse
                  voltage is higher than 6 V

                For GPIO set to input mode only, it is not a good practice to leave it open/floating,
                The hardware design needs to controlled it with determined supply or ground voltage
                is necessary.

                This option provides a software workaround for this issue. Configure to isolate all
                GPIO pins in sleep state.

                To reduce leakage current, some types of SPI Flash/RAM only need to pull up the CS pin
                during light sleep. But there are also some kinds of SPI Flash/RAM that need to pull up
                all pins. It depends on the SPI Flash/RAM chip used.

                When the chip exits deep sleep, the CPU and the flash chip are powered on
                at the same time. CPU will run deep sleep stub first, and then
                proceed to load code from flash. Some flash chips need sufficient
                time to pass between power on and first read operation. By default,
                without any extra delay, this time is approximately 900us, although
                some flash chip types need more than that.

                By default extra delay is set to 2000us. When optimizing startup time
                for applications which require it, this value may be reduced.

                If you are seeing "flash read err, 1000" message printed to the
                console after deep sleep reset, try increasing this value.
